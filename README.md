The project can simply be run by command

npm run dev

I have done my best to break the interface into small components and
then develope each and then combine again.

I have made main 4 pages as well as the cart popup.
I also include the menu for mobile
It is completely responsive for all devices

There may be a lot of mistakes but It was my first chance to work
by using Figma design.

And Alhamdulilah I have completely develped it on my own.
